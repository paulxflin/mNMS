Moderne Numbers Manipulation System, a.k.a. Moderne Avatar System (MAS)

MAS is a Numbers Manipulation System that uses probabilistic models to provide a portable and transparent general computational system for arbitrary data storage deice and arbitrary programs, utilising the essential elements metal (jin), wood (moku), water (sui), earth (dot), fire (ka), and air (kaze). The Kernel/Shadow/Sage (kage) is expressed as a cycle (rin) and it stores information utilising the infinity (mugen) symbol, encoded in base 42 (omni), defined by the function y = sin x (wave), where x is expressed in radians as a fraction of 2PI (pi).  

Taken all together, MAS represents all possible elements of the universe utilising these 10 characters. When added together, the elements represent exactly 37 characters, which is a prime number, 5 removed from the number 42, allowing for fast conversion to the Binary (base 2), Byte/Char (base 8), Decimal (base 10), and Hexadecimal (base 16) System, and Omni (base 42) using the base change formula. 

This system is implementation agnostic, and looks to support all programming languages utilising complex number probabilistic mathematics. The open source project in this repo is maintained by Xiaofeng Paul Lin, and all copyrights is reserved by him and his majority ownership companies including Likbong, Moderne, and XREngine.
